🚀 DSA Pattern-Based Problem Bank (FAANG Level)
A comprehensive, structured, and pattern-based collection of Data Structures & Algorithms problems from Basic → Advanced, curated for FAANG interview preparation.
This repository follows the Pattern-Based Learning Approach, which is the most effective method used by top candidates to crack coding interviews.
📌 Patterns > Random Questions
Patterns help you identify the underlying logic, making any new problem predictable and easier to solve.

📌 About This Repository
This repository contains:
✔️ 200+ curated DSA problems
✔️ Categorized by patterns, not random topics
✔️ Clickable problem links (LeetCode, CodeStudio, GFG, Codeforces)
✔️ Solutions in multiple languages (optional)
✔️ Ideal for FAANG interviews, college students, and competitive programmers

🎯 Why Pattern-Based Approach?
Most FAANG problems repeat these patterns with small variations.
Once you master the pattern:
✔️ You understand the logic
✔️ You reduce solution time
✔️ You can solve unseen problems with ease
✔️ You become interview-ready faster
